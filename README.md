This is a collection of musical experiments which take the form of instruments which resist your attempts to control them, in some fashion.

* [XTRIMENT0](XTRIMENT0/index.html): the keys are tuned to a scale, but each time you play a note, the scale will change.
* [XTRIMENT1](XTRIMENT1/index.html): each tab of this can only play one note, open multiple tabs to make your own keyboard.
* [XTRIMENT10](XTRIMENT10/index.html): a drum machine withâ€¦ *inconvenient* rhythmic spacing.
